									Naxals are the main reason for no development in Jharkhand. Every year many innocent lives are taken by them. Why doesn't the Indian army step in? They are not our people as they kill their own countrymen. Taking up weapons just because their demands are not being fulfilled is not a valid reason.

									The Naxalites operate in a wide area in these two states that is filled with deep forests, mountains and rivers. The terrain is difficult and task is hard (identifying who is the friend and who is the enemy). If US Army found it that hard in Vietnam, it is not going to be a piece of cake for the Indian Army to fight such a guerilla war in a massive and heavily inhabited terrain. Armies have a lot of fire power, but none of the world armies are trained to tackle sustained guerilla warfare. It will be a really expensive war.
								</p>

								<p class="article_padding">
									Using an army inside a country, anywhere in the world, should be the last resort. Armies are not trained for the tasks that police can do. The police have deeper ground relationships and understand the terrain & people much better than the army. In past success stories, such as containing terrorism in Punjab, it was the police who led the charge in anti-terrorism. Armies will further alienate the locals as they are not designed to be people-friendly.
								</p>
								<b>3</b>
								<p class="article_padding">
									The army is already overextended in two frontiers. Giving them an additional headache for a marginal gain is not in India's best interests.
								</p>

								<p class="article_padding">
									Using an army in the middle of the country will signal to the world that India's administration is unable to get the house fixed the normal way.
								</p>
								<b>5</b>
								<p class="article_padding">
									Most importantly, India's naxal problem is a socioeconomic issue that is aggravated by bad politics. The affected regions are highly corrupted and have pathetic infrastructure. While there is no justification for an armed struggle, it will be equally stupid to use the extreme option without paying attention to fixing the ground realities.
								</p>

								<p class="article_padding">
									The Army of any nation (specially Democracy nations) never stand up against its own people unless if its a Military Coup. The People whom we call naxalites are also Indian nationals, but yes they are Anti-Democratic and to some extent Pro-Communist in Beliefs. They are Against the Government BUT they are Not against the Nation. You should understand that there is HUGE difference between Government and Nation. Now the biggest problem here is The Army is NOT trained to distinguish between Enemy and Friendly when they are at war. Because while at Border and War Zone , its clear cut orders that Whatever comes infront is the Enemy. Whereas here in the Jungles of Chhattisgarh , Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal , Telangana, Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh , along with Naxalites, Many counts of innocent Tribals people also live. Army won’t be able to distinguish between the Friendlies , Inncocent or Naxalites. So this distinguishing feature is coming under the topic of “Policing” which is completely out of the box for Army. Thats why here comes the role of Central Armed Police Forces like CRPF , ITBP , BSF , SSB whose personals are trained both in Policing and Combating nature. They do their functions of fighting against naxalites with the help of State Police Force and local Government bodies.

									Now you will say Even the Kashmir is also a part of India , then why indian Army is deployed there. Yes , i agree Kashmir anad its people are Indians only , but some sects of kashmiri population are against the Nation. They are Anti-Nation. Being a Anti-Government is way better than being a Anti-Nation. They are supported by India’s “Back-stage Enemies” Pakistan and China. So this turns out to be a serious threat to the integrity and unity of India, and also is a threat from outside country. So for this reason , Indian Army is deployed in kashmir to control the situation. But you should also know that In Kashmir , only Army doesnt stand alone. The CRPF is also deployed there to help the Army in controlling the situation in kashmir and help in Policing matters. So directly or indirectly , we can say the CAPF arms play a huge role in maintaining stability INSIDE the nation. Army is BEST at saving the nation from Outside threats , but Policing and Internal security is BEST in CAPF hands.

									Jharkhand and Chhattishgarh are not in such a need that Indian Government has to send the army to fight against Naxalites.
								</p>
								<p class="article_padding">
									I am native of highly Naxalite affected area of Jharkhand (Latehar, Garhwa and Palamau District) and done my college from Chhattishgarh. So, I am aware of situations in these two states. I have lived my early life in these areas, even through I haven’t seen a troop of naxalite marching, although heard some stories about it. In early nineties naxalites were dominated the area and killed some of the prominent people including one of my grandfather’s brother and some of my friends also lost their relative at that time, but things are in control now, as Jharkhand Police and CRPF have done a great work to control it. Many naxali area commanders has either surrendered or killed by our security personnel in Jharkhand.
								</p>
								<p class="article_padding">
									One story that I heard is one area commander committed suicide in fear of getting killed by the police in Garhwa. He was in such a depression that the fear of getting caught by security personal intended him to take his own life. So, we can say that these anti elements are in fear of our police.

										Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das recently told The Hindu that Jharkhand that ‘No Maoists in Jharkhand’ by stating “There are no Maoists. Like you have organised criminal syndicates in cities, pickpockets and other petty criminals have formed an organised group to extort wherever there is a road project or some fund flow … Rebels have an ideology, but thugs need to be treated like thugs,”.
									</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									In chhattishgarh especially in Dantevara (a district on the border of Odissa) have some problem but that doesn’t mean army operation is required there, CRPF and State Police can deal with them, sometimes it result in loss of security personal because they are not fully aware of that dense forest area and wrong information given to them to trap, but now they the doing good in peace keeping in that area also. Chhattishgarh has also made numbers of naxalites to surrender and come with the mainstream life but economical imbalance and isolated site with some mind wash led them to take firearms against their own people, here government have to actually work instead of sending army troop there.
								</p>
								<p class="article_padding">
									So, problem is not that much serious that army have to go to deal with that, CRPF and state police are more than enough for them.
